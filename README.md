# NW Resource Calc

Hello, this is a simple resource amount calculator for New World game, until now it has very limited available resources.

## Motivation

The main motivation for stating this project was because I started studying Typescript and wanted a project to practice.

Also, another motivation was that a friend created a spreadsheet to calculate how many resources we needed to build anything, and sometimes I asked him "How many [RESOURCE] do I need to create X?".

## Future(?)

I'll add more resources as needed when I play with my friends.

But, if you want to contribute to expand the resource list, feel free to open a PR adding more resources to [resources.json](resources.json) file on the root of the project.

### Possibilities

- Create a database with resources
- Add resource images
- Add more resources information
- Show where we can get the resource
- Or any other good idea!
